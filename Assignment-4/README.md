# 📌 Assignment 4 – Singly Linked List (CS 2172)

## 📖 Overview  
This repository contains my solution for **Assignment 4** of the **Data Structure Lab (CS 2172)**.  
The focus of this assignment is on implementing and managing **singly linked lists** in C, with all operations maintaining sorted order (descending) where required.  

---

## 🛠️ Key Objectives  
- Implement a **singly linked list** to store integers  
- Maintain nodes in **descending order**  
- Write functions to **insert, search, delete, and display** elements  
- Extend functionality with **reverse, sort, update, merge, and free operations**  

---

## 🔑 Implemented Functionalities  

### **Part 1 – Core Operations**  
- Add elements in sorted order  
- Search for an element’s position  
- Delete an element from the list  
- Print the list in a readable format  

### **Part 2 – Extended Management**  
- Free all nodes in a list  
- Reverse the list (resulting in ascending order)  
- Update list nodes with random values (breaking sorted order)  
- Re-sort the list back into descending order  
- Merge two sorted lists into a single sorted list (without extra memory allocation)  

---

## 🎯 Learning Outcomes  
- Improved understanding of **dynamic memory management** in C  
- Practiced **pointer manipulation** for linked list operations  
- Learned to maintain sorted order without extra storage  
- Strengthened problem-solving skills in **data structures**
